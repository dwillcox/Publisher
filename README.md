# Publisher

Publisher is a compact Python code for transforming plaintext in Markdown and
YAML syntax into publishable content.

Publisher structures content into a Sequence of Scenes.

Each Scene is an ordered set of text and figures.

Various factory classes can then be defined to transform a Sequence into
publishable form.

Right now the only output format supported is HTML, but it would be easy to
generate LaTeX, for example.

I plan to do that in the future.
